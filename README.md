### Step 0: Download and Unzip Carla

Download [Carla version 0.9.14](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.14) from the official source. After downloading, unzip the contents. You do not have to put the contents under the root of this project. To start the simulator, run `CarlaUE4.exe`.

### Step 1: Install the Required Packages

Install the necessary packages by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Step 2:Train an Agent

Run Script `train_agent.py`
- Train New Model: `train_new_model("PPO_highway_lane_tracking", total_timesteps=200000, hyperparams=hyperparams2)`
- Train Exist Model: `train_exist_model(model_path, total_timesteps=100000, hyperparams=hyperparams2)`
- Evaluate Model: `train_exist_model(model_path, total_timesteps=100000, hyperparams=hyperparams2)`
